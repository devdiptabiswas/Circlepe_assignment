This code sets up a React-based web development project. It initializes a new React app, installs key dependencies like Tailwind CSS for styling and Framer Motion for animations, and configures the project structure. The setup includes basic React components (a Layout component for page transitions and an App component as the main entry point), integrates Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling, and incorporates Framer Motion for smooth animations. This foundation is designed to facilitate the development of a responsive, animated website using modern web technologies and practices.
